  description: '**Heap Sort** is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages the binary heap data structure to achieve consistent O(n log n) performance. Built upon the foundation of **Selection Sort\'s** concept of repeatedly finding and placing the minimum element, **Heap Sort** dramatically improves efficiency by using a heap to quickly identify the maximum element in each iteration. The algorithm operates in two main phases: first, it transforms the input array into a max heap where each parent node is greater than its children; then, it repeatedly extracts the maximum element (root of the heap) and places it at the end of the array while maintaining the heap property for the remaining elements. This approach combines the best aspects of **merge sort\'s** guaranteed performance with **insertion sort\'s** in-place operation. Unlike **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort** never degrades beyond O(n log n), making it suitable for real-time systems where predictable performance is crucial.',

      timeComplexity: {
        best: "Even when the array is already sorted, Heap Sort must build the initial heap (O(n)) and then perform n-1 extract-max operations, each requiring O(log n) time to restore the heap property. This gives O(n log n) total time.",
        average: "The algorithm performs two main phases: building the initial heap takes O(n) time, and extracting n elements from the heap takes O(n log n) time since each extraction requires O(log n) time to heapify. The dominant factor is O(n log n).",
        worst: "The worst case occurs when the heap property is maximally violated after each extraction, requiring the maximum number of comparisons and swaps during heapify operations. However, this still results in O(n log n) time complexity due to the logarithmic height of the heap."
      },
      spaceComplexity: {
        best: "Standard recursive implementation requires O(log n) auxiliary space due to the recursion call stack during heapify operations, with stack depth proportional to the height of the heap.",
        average: "Average case maintains O(log n) space complexity as the heap structure ensures logarithmic depth for all heapify operations.",
        worst: "Worst case also remains O(log n) as the heap height is always logarithmic. Alternative iterative implementation can achieve O(1) auxiliary space complexity by avoiding recursion entirely."

    "Guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity in all cases - no worst-case degradation",
    "In-place sorting - can achieve O(1) auxiliary space with iterative implementation",
